# GameTools
An addon for Blender 2.8 to assist in my game asset creation.

Currently only has two functions to speed up high poly creation. A button in the side panel will apply smoothing, bevel, and subsurf modifiers to the selected meshes. And a second button to use the multiobject renamer. It's useful when you need to do quick bakes in substance painter and need _high and _low added to each meshes name.
