# GameTools
An addon for Blender 2.8 to assist in my game asset creation.

Currently only has one function to speed up high poly creation. A button in the side panel will apply smoothing, bevel, and subsurf modifiers to the selected meshes.

Plans are to merge the renamer addon into GameTools and to better enhance its functionality.
